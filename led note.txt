The left set of pins is the input side, and the right set is the output side. If you plug the data pin coming off an arduino, roborio, etc... into the output side they will not turn on.
On either of the sets of pins from left to right it goes Ground, Data, 5V+ with 5V+ being the square pin.
To operate at a consistent full white brightness, 5V 2.3A are needed to run the 48 LEDs on the PCB with one LED drawing 48mA.
The LEDs connected to the 5V 2A connection on the CTRE VRM should be fine but if you add any more LEDs to your robot it is STRONGLY reccommended to give it more amps.
